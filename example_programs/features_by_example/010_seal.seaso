# If statement A seals type T, and statement B is a rule with a T-type consequent,
# then B _breaks the seal on T_ unless A _knows_ B.

# For statements at the root of the program, _knows_ is the (expected) precedence relation.
# The idea is that the author of the Nth statement knows all earlier statements, but not later statements.
# In this example, seal int knows rule 1 but not rule 2, so only the latter breaks the seal on int!

rule 1.
seal int.
rule 2.
