# formalize: non-empty iff. there are some items
decl item. defn nonEmpty().

# The following rule would be type-ambiguous. `I` has unknown type!
# rule nonEmpty() :- I.

# this is a workaround
defn bogus(item).
rule nonEmpty(), bogus(I) :- I.

# Ideally, we extend Seaso s.t. the following is allowed:
# defn nonEmpty() :- I:int.
