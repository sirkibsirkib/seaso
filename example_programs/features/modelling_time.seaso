# Unlike other languages (like eFLINT), statement order in Seaso has
# no affect on the results of inference.

# Time can instead be modelled "in the data".

# For example, "food cannot be sold after it is eaten"
defn time(int). before(time,time). food(str).
defn sold_at(food,time). eaten_at(food,time).
defn sale_after_eat(food). emit sale_after_eat.

rule before(X,Z) :- before(X,Y), before(Y,Z).

rule sale_after_eat(F) :- eaten_at(F,T1), before(T1,T2), sold_at(F,T2).
