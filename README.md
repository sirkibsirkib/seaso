# Seaso Executor

## Installation
1. Have a relatively modern Rust language compiler (https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed along with `cargo`, Rust's package manager. I suggest just leaning on the Rust package manager (https://rustup.rs/). 
2. Use `git` to clone this repo.
3. Compile the executor with `cargo build --release`

## Usage
Run the executor with your source code as input. For example, `./target/release/seaso_executor.exe < ./program_examples/toy.seaso`.
